## Introduction

**immediate.js** is a microtask library, based on [NobleJS's setImmediate](https://github.com/NobleJS/setImmediate), but stealing the best ideas from [Cujo's When](https://github.com/cujojs/when) and [RSVP][RSVP].

immediate takes the tricks from setImmedate and RSVP and combines them with the schedualer from when.

Note versions 2.6.5 and earlier were strictly speaking a 'macrotask' library not a microtask one, [see this for the difference](https://github.com/YuzuJS/setImmediate#macrotasks-and-microtasks), if you need a macrotask library, [I got you covered](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/macrotask).

## The Tricks

### `process.nextTick`

Note that we check for *actual* Node.js environments, not emulated ones like those produced by browserify or similar.
Such emulated environments often already include a `process.nextTick` shim that's not as browser-compatible as
setImmediate.js.

### `MutationObserver`

This is what [RSVP][RSVP] uses, it's very fast, details on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver)

### `postMessage`

In Firefox 3+, Internet Explorer 9+, all modern WebKit browsers, and Opera 9.5+, [`postMessage`][postMessage] is
available and provides a good way to queue tasks on the event loop. It's quite the abuse, using a cross-document
messaging protocol within the same document simply to get access to the event loop task queue, but until there are
native implementations, this is the best option.

Note that Internet Explorer 8 includes a synchronous version of `postMessage`. We detect this, or any other such
synchronous implementation, and fall back to another trick.

Also note that Internet Explorer 10 has a bug relating to [refusing to yield the queue](https://github.com/cujojs/when/issues/197) which effects setImmediate, postMessage and MessageChannel

### `MessageChannel`

Unfortunately, `postMessage` has completely different semantics inside web workers, and so cannot be used there. So we
turn to [`MessageChannel`][MessageChannel], which has worse browser support, but does work inside a web worker.

### `<script> onreadystatechange`

For our last trick, we pull something out to make things fast in Internet Explorer versions 6 through 8: namely,
creating a `<script>` element and firing our calls in its `onreadystatechange` event. This does execute in a future
turn of the event loop, and is also faster than `setTimeout(â€¦, 0)`, so hey, why not?

## Tricks we don't use

### `setImmediate`
We avoid this process.nextTick in node is better suited to our needs and in Internet Explorer 10 there is a broken version of setImmediate we avoid using this.

## Usage

In the browser, include it with a `<script>` tag; pretty simple. Creates a global
called `immediate` which should act like setImmediate. It also has a method called
`clear` which should act like `clearImmediate`.

In Node.js, do

```
npm install immediate
```

then

```js
var immediate = require("immediate");
```

somewhere early in your app; it attaches to the global.
